          <p class="firstInfo">
            Although, water bodies such as Deepor Beel and Maguri Beel are well
            known for hosting birds, there are also smaller patches of wetlands
            which do not meet the international criteria of being a Ramsar Site
            or an Important Birding Area (IBA), but are equally important for
            the ecosystem as well as the communities residing alongside. One
            such example of a water body is Satajaan, a wetland situated in the
            North-Lakhimpur district of Assam. It is at a distance of
            approximately 8 km from the Lakhimpur township. The infamous wetland
            situated adjacent to the Pahumara-Kimin state highway and National
            Highway 15 is one of the last surviving wetlands of the region
            hosting enormous bird species every year. Being aside the river
            Ranganadi, the wetland with marshes and dense fringing vegetation
            receives fresh water recharge every monsoon. According to a research
            work published in December 2019 by Department of Botany, Rajiv
            Gandhi University, Arunachal Pradesh, there are 262 species of
            vascular plants on the wetland.
          </p>
          <p class="secondInfo">
            The wetland hordes the bird species from the onset of October till
            their return by the end of March or early April, enjoying the
            landscape which supports the roosting and breeding of birds. Some of
            the local non-migratory water birds such as White breasted Waterhen,
            Bronze-winged Jacana, Eurasian Moorehen, Grey-headed Swamphen and
            many others can be found here perennially. The migratory birds such
            as Gadwall which flies across different demographic conditions to
            reach the flood plains of Assam every year, too finds its shelter in
            this wetland. The local migratory waterfowls such as
            Lesser-whistling Duck, Fulvous-whistling Duck, Indian Spotbill Duck
            etc., get dispersed post-winter during their breeding season. In
            addition to the aforementioned water birds, Satajaan also
            accommodates local and migratory terrestrial and bush birds like
            Coucals, variety of Warblers, Starlings, Wagtails, Pipits etc. It
            was indeed astonishing to notice the density of birds in a
            relatively smaller area (39 acres).

          <h2 class="title">Point at Issue</h2>
          <p class="point-at-issue-info">
            When the changing climate is already showing its impact on the
            ecosystem globally, the health of this wetland have been further
            challenged by several anthropogenic activities.The locals says that
            one of the primary reasons for the degradation of the wetland is
            yearly winter picnic accompanied by littering of plastic wastes,
            noise from loud speakers and clearing bushes for fire.
            Unfortunately, the time of the year also coincides with the arrival
            of migratory birds and human activities such as picnics disturb the
            natural state of avifauna. The wetland which is claimed to have got
            created by the devastating earthquake of 1950, has also observed the
            disturbances caused by sand mining along the river Ranganadi during
            the non-monsoon season. It is the same river which is already under
            pressure due to the upstream water infrastructure projects and has
            observed reduced hydrological flow. Presence of non-insulated
            high-tension wires around the wetland have added to the threats of
            lives of these flying birds and frequent cases of electrocution of
            birds are observed.

          <p class="tone-down-info">
            There should be frequent documentation of the birds which will
            provide the temporal diversity of avifauna in the wetland. The
            birders can also upload their sightings to eBird.org (a citizen
            science based online inventory to report bird and their count in a
            given area) to make the data accessible to public. Interdisciplinary
            researches must be conducted to understand this wetland from
            technical as well as social perspective. Along with the birds, there
            could also be a decent diversity of Herpetofauna and a documentation
            can be carried out, the results of which might interest researchers
            across the globe and demand conservation of this wetland from a
            policy level. If Satajaan wetland is not scientifically managed
            following the Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2017
            (updated on 2020) by Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate
            Change, Government of India, there is always a chance that the
            wetland will lose its charisma as well as importance of being
            resourceful. Intervention from the Government will also be utmost
            important to prohibit any kind of disturbances to the wetland
            through human activities, especially when winter is here and picnic
            plans are on its way. However, the efforts led need not be limited
            to Satajaan or any one wetland. Each swamp has its own importance
            and must be protected to the level best.

            <b> Baliram Gogoi </b> is a busy man. The 78-year-old wakes up
            around 4.30 am despite the cold, takes a stick and his mobile phone,
            and makes a round of Satajan, a 270-bigha wetland on the banks of
            the Ranganadi here, checking if any poacher had got closer to trap a
            bird. “Satajan is not only home to so many species of birds but is
            also a destination for several migratory species,” said Baliram, a
            farmer who was earlier associated with the district unit of the
            Village Defence Organisation, a body formed during the Chinese
            aggression of 1962 to help villagers. Baliram knows most of the
            species by their local and English names. “It is difficult to
            remember the scientific names, so I have bought several books to
            refer to whenever I need to find out or tell visitors about the
            different birds,” he said. Bird species that have been listed here
            include common teal, purple moorhen, lesser adjutant stork, gadwall,
            lesser whistling teal, night heron, ferruginous duck, darter or
            snake-bird, and spotted bill among others. Sadly, he is no more with
            us and his work is being carried out by his son
            <b> Mr. Lakhidhar Gogoi </b> along with other members of the
            community.
